## Day1

Exercise 5 Observations:

Using the GET method in the browser header we get shown our "hidden" field containing 1234567.

USING THE POST method in the browser header the hidden field is shown again. It also contains the params we put in our input forms. so the final order for the url is: url/inputparams/hiddenfiles.

I can observe, by running index2.html, by looking in the network pane / headers that our method is set to POST. The method is send succesfully but is never used elsewhere cause i didnt save it elsewhere.

Exercise 6 Answer:

The server can maintain state between subsequent calls by using sessions. Opening a session creates a HTTP request, which is executed and then the session is terminated ready so open a new session.

Exercise 7 Answer:

Cookies are saved in the client computer and beyond the browser. Cookies are a sort of caches and therefore can be reused again even when the browser has been closed.
